I don't have to tell you things are bad
everybody knows things are bad
it's a depression

everybody's out of work
or scared of losing their jobs
the dollar buys a nickel's worth
banks are going bust
shopkeepers keep a gun under the counter
punks are running wild in the street
there seems to be nobody anywhere 
who seems to know what to do and 
there's no end to it

we know
the air is unfit to breathe
and our food is unfit to eat
we sit
watching tv
while some local newscaster tells us
that today we had: '15 homicides
and 63 violent crimes
as though that's the way things 
are supposed to be!'
we know things are bad
worse than bad
they're crazy
its like everything everywhere is going crazy
so we don't go out anymore
we sit in the house
and slowly the world we're living in is getting smaller
and all we say is 'please
at least leave us alone in our living rooms
let me have my toaster and my tv and my steel-belted radials and i wont say anything
just leave us alone
well
im not going to leave you alone
i want you to get mad

i dont want you to protest
i dont want you to riot
i dont want you to write to your congressman because i wouldn't know what to tell you to write
i dont know what to do about
the depression or
the inflation or
the russians or
the crime in the street
all i know is that first
you've got to get mad
you've got to say
i'm a human being
god damn it
my life has value
