i used to have never been to church
at least
not in the way that
centuries and millenia of
playboys and zealots proclaim
they endured their childhood religious trauma
partly because my younger brother and i were
never really brought up
hardly at all but
particularly not in any
uncertain terms of adding god
to the end of every
'thank you'
and every
'i'm sorry'
and before all the
'i'm worried that you're lonely's
and the
'i think that there's things you're not telling me's

when i got left alone to think
i started scheming
coming up with things like
the american dream or
chocolate chip cookies and ice cream
or even screaming
after silver white trucks
for icy sundays
on the white hot sundays
that i needed heat treatment
because some days
the cali suns rays
required spf ten million

and we could be cooking
a full english breakfast
on the overheating hood of our civic
with the maybe babytrans friends
in the back seat
arms
all the way around each other
firearms
in the way way back under the covers
harmless
like
id only go and make them all an omelet
because
i might be a little bit scrambled
but its not like i think ill win them over easy
im just kinda good at breaking eggs
over the dashboards of running cars

its not like they begged after the past me
to enchant them or anything
its hardly their fault
if i imagined myself a partner piece
because to be
on the frontline
in the front part
of the fighting
is to know thine enemy
as thee knows thyself
and to find them wanting

so
as the light flies
through the dark spaces
and these poets keep lying
through their gritted teeth and
deferred seated sentences
discussing different truths and
determining the limits of their senses
i find myself
once more
in the confession booth
of a church
i dont recognize
writing sideways letters to the editor in red pen
st st stuttering alone among the lonely pews
stumbling
one more bumbling protagonist through
yet another half written short story in my turn of prose
trust notes app opened
closed
reopened
reclosed
reading the new words enclosed
rereading old pieces i must have rewritten
over and over until the bell has long since stopped tolling
and all the prayer rats
have finished chasing church mice tails
and they and their fat snakes
have all but slithered home

because the bar
for good people
is underneath the floor of hell
like
anything better than meddling
in every aspect of my humanity
is considered a happiness
and i just cant stand tumbling
in the porcelain shards for another second
without organizing my scattered thoughts
at least
i can store the leftover shots
instead of unloading the rounds
cocked hammer exploding black powder
bang
fire in the theatre
but theres nobody around to hear the screaming
satin stitched patterns of prophecies torn to streamers
by golden chain gauntlets disguising metal claws
the type some distant ancestor recalls
as ripping bits and pieces off of limbs
and tearing wings from faeries

thrown
as a gauntlet
as a battlecry
to the floor
as a declaration of immortal armaments
a call to war
a challenge
to take action
to take care
of yourself
and one and all

i dont leave church
until midnight these days
when the monday sabbath rolls over
into the dirty hazy fog of a tuesday morning
when the gravestones
of half remembered names
that might show up on fresh faces
with new rhythms

and its nice
to finally be singing hers
instead of hymns
